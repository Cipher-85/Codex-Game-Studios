# Manifest version mismatch

Check: does the story's embedded Manifest Version match the current manifest header date?
If they differ, use `numbered choice prompt` before proceeding:
- Prompt: "Story was written against manifest v[story-date]. Current manifest is v[current-date]. New rules may apply. How do you want to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Update story manifest version and implement with current rules (Recommended)`
  - `[B] Implement with old rules — I accept the risk of non-compliance`
  - `[C] Stop here — I want to review the manifest diff first`

If [A]: edit the story file's `Manifest Version:` field to the current manifest date before spawning the programmer. Then read the manifest carefully for new rules.
If [B]: edit the story file's `Manifest Version:` field to the current manifest date AND add a `Manifest-Note: Proceeded with old manifest rules on [date] — non-compliance risk accepted.` line to the story header. Read the manifest for new rules anyway. Note the decision in the Phase 6 summary under "Deviations". `$story-done` will include the Manifest-Note in its deviations section without re-checking staleness.
If [C]: stop. Do not spawn any agent. Let the user review and re-run `$dev-story`.
