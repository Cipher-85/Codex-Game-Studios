## Phase 4b: QA Coverage Gate

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning QL-TEST-COVERAGE:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "QL-TEST-COVERAGE skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 5.
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "QL-TEST-COVERAGE skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 5.
- `full` → spawn as normal.

After completing the deviation checks in Phase 4, spawn `qa-lead` via Codex subagent delegation using gate **QL-TEST-COVERAGE** (`.codex/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass:
- The story file path and story type
- Test file paths found during Phase 3 (exact paths, or "none found")
- The story's `## QA Test Cases` section (the pre-written test specs from story creation)
- The story's `## Acceptance Criteria` list

The qa-lead reviews whether the tests actually cover what was specified — not just whether files exist.

Apply the verdict:
- **ADEQUATE** → proceed to Phase 5
- **GAPS** → flag as **ADVISORY**: "QA lead identified coverage gaps: [list]. Story can complete but gaps should be addressed in a follow-up story."
- **INADEQUATE** → flag as **BLOCKING**: "QA lead: critical logic is untested. Verdict cannot be COMPLETE until coverage improves. Specific gaps: [list]."

Skip this phase for Config/Data stories (no code tests required).

## Phase 5: Lead Programmer Code Review Gate

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning LP-CODE-REVIEW:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "LP-CODE-REVIEW skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 6 (completion report).
- `lean` → use `numbered choice prompt` before proceeding:
  - Prompt: "Code review is skipped in lean mode. Did you run `$code-review` on the implemented files?"
  - Options:
    - `Yes — $code-review passed or was approved with suggestions`
    - `No — skipping code review for this story`
    - `No — I'll run $code-review before the sprint close-out`
  - Record the answer in the completion notes (Phase 7). All three options proceed to Phase 6.
- `full` → spawn as normal.

Spawn `lead-programmer` via Codex subagent delegation using gate **LP-CODE-REVIEW** (`.codex/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass: implementation file paths, story file path, relevant GDD section, governing ADR.

Present the verdict to the user. If CONCERNS, surface them via `numbered choice prompt`:
- Options: `Revise flagged issues` / `Accept and proceed` / `Discuss further`
If REJECT, do not proceed to Phase 6 verdict until the issues are resolved.

If the story has no implementation files yet (verdict is being run before coding is done), skip this phase and note: "LP-CODE-REVIEW skipped — no implementation files found. Run after implementation is complete."
